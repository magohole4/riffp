Simple RIFF parser in Python 

## Why?
Needed one for [m3u2metadata](https://github.com/magohole4/riffp) and had to create a simple RIFF parser (because all the other ones are sh\*t) and this format isn't very well documented frankly.

## Example
See [m3u2metadata](https://github.com/magohole4/riffp) for an example on changing metadata.

## Bugs
If you encounter a bug, submit an issue, say something, or do what you want.

## Warranty
No warranty, backup your files before running.

## N00b
Please notice that this is part my first Python program, contanct me for advice on good practices, etc.
